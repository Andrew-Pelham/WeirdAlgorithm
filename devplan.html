<p> <b> Platforms </b> </p>
<p> In terms of platforms, we plan to primarily use PHP for back end development, and HTML for the front end, with MySQL powering the database. </p>
<p> <b>Data Source</b> </p>
<p>Our data is sourced from the Carnegia Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary, a dictionary with over 134,000 words and their pronunications and syllables. The words are based on the ARPAbet standards for pronunciation.</p>

<p> <b>Labor Division</b> <p>
<p>As for workload, we plan to have Matthew work on primarily back end, and Andrew and Brian working on front end and linking. However, we are prepared to dynamically shift if the need arises and to give each of us at least some experience with both ends. </p>

<p> <b>Timeline</b> <p>
<p>October 22: Layout of front end completed, and data functioning in the database, as well as basic connection between the two. </p>
<p>November 3: Able to implement all required database operations and performance for stage 3</p>
<p>December 1: Finished implementation of the project </p>
<p>December 5: Video demo finished </p>
<p>December 10: Final Demo </p>
